Performance Optimization:
	-See if we can narrow down number of bodies considered when checking collisions (remove doodads entirely)
		-Or come up with a new class of object that is just an image. No actor, no body, static sprite
		-Tile object?
	-Draw a solid box around vicinity areas to prevent anything from going outside. Box moves with map area vicinity.
		-Also need solid walls at edge of map. Unsure how to ensure bounding boxes don't collide.
	-Map area tracker stored in profile (break map down into ~70x70 squares?)

Game Notes:
	-Unique Item: supercharge engines ("emergency vector engines"). screen shake and increase thrust

General Dev:
	-Add UI Box movement patterns/styles and interface methods (Display should already move along with it I think)
	-Revisit if area query during spawn is implemented/working. Look at Troupe:dimensions property
	-Resolve whether actor shakeScreen action should have a default interval of its deathtimer if not specified.
	-Determine if to keep Actor.getCalloutInfo and actual stats

Next Steps
----------------------------
-Map
	-Districts within the map (random names. slum, district) with some defining characteristic (architecture, color)
	-Come up with procgen chamber/district names
	-Can store if region has been visited before. This can then be used for map purposes.
		-Map can break down data into region squares. Unsure exactly how these would be represented visually.
		-Maybe have a dark grid with blue lines, and visited regions are filled in with color.

-Enemies:
	-Enemies cannot be allowed to wander outside of active areas.
		-Query every few seconds and put ones too far out to sleep?
	-Floating, rotating spherical turret. Laser attack.
	-Stationary, enemy-spawners (possibly on ceiling as well). Small floating enemies spawned from it.
		-Need a way to track/limit number of enemies spawned from a single source (create a spawn counter)
		-Write spawnEnemy() action. Could possibly include this with shoot actions
	-Stationary, spiked areas. Doodads with a payload with force value. Full-sized sensor box and smaller structure box to give solidity.
	-Stationary, single linked arm, worm-like. Actor at tip that directs entire chain (and body?)
	-Floating, amoeba-like creatures
	-Stationary, spawner, creates "shots" that drop.
		-Spawner possibly invisible (ornament).
		-Limited dripping animation built into drop
		-Acid explosion animation on contact
	-Camouflaged enemies that change/animate appearance when they're stationary.
		-Either mimic terrain or become transparent.
		-Possibly include some sort of transition sprite animation mode/frames

-Terrain/Doodads:
	-Water doodads probably would also need to be above player z-index.


-UI:
	-Boxes:
		-Side area contains stacked game log. Also possibly objectives/missions/quests
		-Game state stats (city name, district name, player statuses, objective)



Eventual To-Dos:
-See what functionality can be removed from Runner or Engine.
-Remove unused rendering code (constraints, wireframes, polygons, anything else). Probably just comment out and leave for debug purposes.



----------------------------

Unique Items
-Energy shield (refractor): stops damage from lasers
-Missile bonuses: faster, increase damage/yield, guidance system (seeks enemies), armored, smaller attack cooldown, multi-missile launcher
-Item collector: sensor that increases hitbox or drags items towards you
-Something that reduces laser ammo spent
-Drones: laser turret, guidance drone (locks on missiles). Unsure how drones will have their own logic/behavior
-Smart bullets: a small front sensor that shot orients towards
-Engine upgrades (Fuel Purifier/Condenser): faster top speed
-Inertia reduction 1 (Stiener Field, Inertial Battery): better handling (apply more reverse force if going in direction opposite of force)
-Inertia reduction 2 (Mach Engine): faster acceleration (extra force applied when moving from rest for extra kick)


Non-Uniform Distribution
(http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16110758/generate-random-number-with-a-non-uniform-distribution)
-Normal distribution: sin(x*pi)^2   => shallower:  0.65 * sin(x*pi)^2
-Opposite of normal, weighted towards edges: 1 - (sin(x*pi)^2)    => shallower: 1-0.65(sin(x*pi)^2)
-Skewed right/high:   sin(x*pi/2)^2
-Skewed left/low:   1 - sin(x*pi/2)^2
